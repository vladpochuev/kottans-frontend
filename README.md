## Git Basic
The course was so interesting because I could use the git commands in practice. I learned more than fifty commands but I recon there is some of them which not so usefull. Also I can't understand why git basic is the first theme, not the second one. It was confusing when you had to learn about git without any knowledge about linux command-line. learngitbranching.js.org helped to find out difference between some actions (merging and rebasing tree branches; pulling and fetching repositories).

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
During the Linux Survival course I've learned more about working with command-line and some shortcuts that can help to simplify the operation with Linux. Also I like the structure of Linux system. Now I realise why so many people using Linux insead of Linux.

## Git Collaboration
The Coursera lets me see many proccesses that programmers use during real work. The advanced levels of the learngitbranching.js.org were very helpful cause I've been finding the solution of some problems I could face during the using of Git.
