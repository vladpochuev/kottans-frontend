## Git Basic
The course was so interesting because I could use the git commands in practice. I learned more than fifty commands but I recon there is some of them which not so usefull. Also I can't understand why git basic is the first theme, not the second one. It was confusing when you had to learn about git without any knowledge about linux command-line. learngitbranching.js.org helped to find out difference between some actions (merging and rebasing tree branches; pulling and fetching repositories).

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
During the Linux Survival course I've learned more about working with command-line and some shortcuts that can help to simplify the operation with Linux. Also I like the structure of Linux system. Now I realise why so many people using Linux insead of Linux.
